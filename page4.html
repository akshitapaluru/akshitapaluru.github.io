    <center><p>Family is everything.
      Family is the first group of people you see.
      They are usually the people you are most comfortable around because you have been with them since young age.
      My direct family consists of four people including me. My brother, my mom, my dad, and me.
      My brother and me have very close connnection and enjoy each others company.
      We have quite a big age difference of 8 years but we get along very well.
      Me and my parents are also very close and I share everything with them.
      To be honest, they are my true best friends.
      I love all my family members.</p></center>
