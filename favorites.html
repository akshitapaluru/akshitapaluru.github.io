      My favorite number is 3.
      I found a liking for three in about first grade. 
      It started when I first thought that three was a lucky number. 
      I also felt that three was the number my teacher used for everything which made me think three was a special number.
      Even though I don't think the same thing about three today it has still stayed my favorite number for all these years.

      My favorite animal is a dolphin. 
      I developed a special liking for dolphins because of a book. 
      When I was small, my mom had read to me a book about how dolphins and humans interacted with each other and became great friends. 
      In fact, when I was young I really wanted to meet a dolphin and see if I could have an interaction with it. 
      It was one of my dreams as a kid. 
      Although my dreams have changed my liking for dolphins has not. 
      Over the years I have learned so much about them and my liking for them has increased.</p></center>

      My favorite sport is badminton.
      Badminton was one of the first sports I ever learned. 
       It's fun and engaging.
       I have been playing for about 7 years now. 
       When I play badminton I have to be swift and have quick reactions.
       One thing I have learned by playing badminton for so many years is to use strategy.
       The ability to place the birdie exactly where you want on the court is important.
       I go to classes outside of school and enjoy them very much.
       I hope to get better at badminton in the future.
