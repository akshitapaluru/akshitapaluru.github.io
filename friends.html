      Friends are one of the gifts you are given in life.
      They understand you and are with you through tough times.
      There are also disagreements between you and your friends but they tend to be what make your friendship even stronger.
      I have many friends.
      I have four close friends some of whom I have known for more than 7 years.
      Their names are Kavana, Prarthi, Saumya and Shravya.
      Here is a picture of all of us together on the first day of 7th grade.</p></center>
