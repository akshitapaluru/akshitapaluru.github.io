      One of the things I like to do for fun is read. 
      Reading opens up new possibilities for me and makes me imagine all sorts of things. 
      I feel like it really lets my brain go free to imagine the story the way I see it.
      When I get really interested in a book the surroundings around me usually are out of the picture. 
      I mostly like reading fictional books because it sets my imagination free.
      Reading is an amzing privelige that I appreciate very much.

      Another things I like to do for fun is rubix cube. 
      I got interested in rubix cubing during covid-9 and I learned from a friend. 
      When I first solved it I was so suprised. 
      It felt good but I also felt acheived.
      As I got better I started to time myself and ever since I just wanted to keep getting faster and faster. 
      Now I can solve a rubix cube in under 25 seconds and have even gone to a few competitions.

      One other thing I like to do for fun is art. 
      Art is something I have been doing since young age.
      I can do many types of sketches and paitings. 
      On the painting side I have experience with watercolers and acrylics. 
      One the sketching side I know how to do figure, perspective, and still life drawings. 
      I like to try a lot of these art styles for fun and even combine them.
      Art lets me create so many images and opens up my creativity. 
      I try to take inspiration for art with things around me. 
      I like drawing nature based things.
      Art is one of my favorite hobbies and I hope to recreate more images in the futre.
